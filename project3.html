      <h2>Project overview</h2>
      <p>
        The main focus of this project was to gain more knowledge of flexbox and grid in order to improve the responsiveness of our website. We learned about relative units and where to use them and several other styling practices such asi min-width
        that improve the fluidity of the layout.

        I styled this website to be mobile-first and proceeded to make some adjustments for bigger screen widths in media queries. The responsiveness was usually achieved by changing the direction of flex, or using flex-wrap, or by changing the
        number of grid columns for a different screen size.

      <p>I styled the images to be 100% width when on mobile, this rule changes to 100% height as soon as the image appears in a multiple column grid.</p>

        Designing the contact form was a good opportunity to practise the control over the grid and e.g. choosing the text area to span over 2 columns. Some elements change their relation to the layout based on the screen width - for example the
        width of the form is at some point set to a maximum value in order to not look inappropriate.
