      <h1>Working with Colors and Animations</h1>
      <h2>Project overview</h2>
      <p>
        The main focus of this project was to explore various approaches in animation and also to observe and use the basic animation conventions and principles. We learned how to translate css animation properties and keyframes into Javascript in
        order to gain more control over the animation. At last, we were shown a Motion One library - a tool that facilitates the build of some basic web interactions.

        In this exercise I improved my knowledge of colour theory by creating a dark mode. This was achieved by creating a media query in css with a preferred colour scheme of dark. I used the same colours except for one shade darker colour of blue
        to create more depth and one shade lighter colour of green for the text to improve contrast and legibility.

        The microinteractions on this website are very subtle - transitions and animations on buttons and links, opacity change on page load, stopping the graphics animation in Javascript on hover and two Motion One on-scroll animations for the text
        transition and graphics rotation.
